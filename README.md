# Calculator-App

This is a simple scientific Calculator i decided to build immediately after learning Python in April 2021.

I decided to write my own libraries to calculate mean, median, mode, probability etc without using already made libraries just to prove to myself that i could.

The app can also do simple arithmetic like addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.


**BAD SIDE OF CODE:**
- The bad thing about the code is i didnt use clear and understandable naming conventions which would make it difficult for anybody to understand what a list or dictionary declared is used for.

- Another bad thing about the code is that there are no comments. 



**NB:** The code can be copied for use by anybody. yoou would need to deploy on a linux machine or ubuntu to view the web app.
